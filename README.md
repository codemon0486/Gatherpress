# GatherPress

## 🎖️ The Goal

GatherPress is the result of the WordPress community's frustration with event management tools that have not met the diverse needs of organizers and members.

## 📃 The Project
This project is for the collaborative effort to build a compelling event management application using open source tools such as _WordPress_ and _BuddyPress_ and the grit sweat and love of **the community, for the community**. 

We're creating the very network features we need to host events and gather well.
